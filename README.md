<hr>
Extension that allow you to bookmark tabs in a single click with pre-named base on date and time. 
<br><br>
It also allow you to close all tabs while keeping one tab that your currently on open. It's basically Ctrl+Shift+D feature but better (IMO).

## HELP REQUEST
I open for name suggestion, I think smart tab bookmarker is not a good represent for this extension. My first idea of creating this extension was One-click bookmark tabs. If you have any better suggestion, please let me know.

### Key Features
- Add random context or name optionally after pre-named 
- Save bookmarks and close other tabs

### ToDo Lists
- Better UI
- Better message dialog

**I have no plan publishing this extension to mozilla website**
