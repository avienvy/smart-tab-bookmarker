Extension that allow you to bookmark tabs in a single click with pre-named base on date and time.

It also allow you to close all tabs while keeping one tab that your currently on open. It's basically Ctrl+Shift+D feature but better (IMO).


## Help Request
I open for name suggestion, I think smart tab bookmarker is not a good represent for this extension. My first idea of creating this extension was One-click bookmark tabs. If you have any better suggestion, please let me know.
